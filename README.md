## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- Media queries

### What I learned

I learnt about the functionality of the grid-template-column in css and also spacing, typography and positioning.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, hsl(252, 100%, 67%), hsl(241, 81%, 54%));
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I want to focus on a programming language and also backend in the future.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Box shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - This helped me for box-shadow syntax understanding. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Adding linear-gradient](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/linear-gradient) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally Linear gradient in CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
